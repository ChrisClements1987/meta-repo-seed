## 🧪 Test-Driven Bug Fix - MANDATORY

### ✅ **TDD for Bug Fixes**
- [ ] **Reproduction test written FIRST** - Test demonstrates the bug
- [ ] **Test initially fails** - Confirms bug reproduction
- [ ] **Fix implemented** - Minimal change to make test pass
- [ ] **Test now passes** - Bug is actually fixed

#### 🔄 Bug Fix TDD Evidence
```bash
# Step 1: Show failing test that reproduces the bug
# Paste output showing test fails before fix

# Step 2: Show passing test after fix applied
# Paste output showing test passes after fix

# Step 3: Show no regressions introduced
# Paste full test suite results showing no new failures
```
