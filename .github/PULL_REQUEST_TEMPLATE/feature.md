## 🧪 Test-Driven Development

### ✅ **TDD Evidence** *(Preferred for new features)*
- [ ] **Tests written FIRST** - I wrote failing tests before any implementation
- [ ] **Test-fail-pass-refactor cycle documented** below
- [ ] **Alternative: Comprehensive diff coverage** - >= 90% on new code with justification for non-TDD approach

#### 🔄 TDD Cycle Documentation
```bash
# Step 1: Show failing tests (if TDD approach used)
# Paste output of initial failing test run

# Step 2: Show passing tests after implementation
# Paste output showing tests now pass

# Step 3: Coverage report
# Paste diff coverage report showing >= 90% coverage on new code
```

### 📊 **Test Coverage Requirements**
- [ ] **Unit tests** - All new functions/classes tested
- [ ] **Integration tests** - Feature works end-to-end
- [ ] **Edge cases** - Error conditions and boundary cases tested
- [ ] **Diff coverage >= 90%** for new features
