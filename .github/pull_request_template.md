## 🧪 Test-Driven Development Compliance

### ✅ **Test Coverage Requirements**
- [ ] **Tests written first (TDD)** OR **comprehensive diff coverage provided** 
- [ ] **All new/changed functionality is covered by tests** (unit and/or integration)
- [ ] **All existing tests pass** OR **failing tests are marked xfail/skip with linked issues**
- [ ] **Diff coverage on changed lines >= 80%** (paste coverage report below)
- [ ] **Global coverage not reduced by more than 0.5%**

### 📊 **Test Evidence**
```bash
# Paste test run results here showing:
# 1. Tests covering new/changed functionality
# 2. Diff coverage percentage on changed lines
# 3. Overall test success rate
```

**Test Files Modified/Added:**
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_*.py` - Unit tests added/modified
- [ ] `tests/integration/test_*.py` - Integration tests added/modified
