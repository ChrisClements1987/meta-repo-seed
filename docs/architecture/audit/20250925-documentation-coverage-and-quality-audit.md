**Solution**: Add automated link checking to CI/CD pipeline
**Implementation**:
```yaml
# Add to .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Check Documentation Links
  uses: lycheeverse/lychee-action@v1
  with:
    args: --verbose --no-progress docs/ README.md
    fail: true
```
**Business Impact**: Prevents user frustration and maintains professional credibility
**Effort**: Small (4-8 hours)

#### 2. **Fix Critical Broken Links**
**Problem**: [Gemini audit](20250927-gemini-audit-report.md) identifies specific broken links
**Solution**: Systematic review and repair of broken documentation links
**Implementation**:
- Review and fix [`docs/README.md`](../README.md) broken references
- Remove or update broken `TEMPLATES.md` link in main README
- Validate all cross-references in documentation hub
**Business Impact**: Immediate user experience improvement
**Effort**: Small (2-4 hours)

### Strategic Improvements (Sprint 2-3)

#### 3. **Create User Journey-Based Landing Pages**
**Problem**: Despite excellent organization, first-time users face complex navigation
**Solution**: Create persona-based documentation entry points
**Implementation**:
- `docs/for-business-leaders.md` - Strategic overview and value proposition
- `docs/for-developers.md` - Technical implementation and contribution
- `docs/for-operators.md` - Deployment, configuration, and maintenance
**Business Impact**: Improved user onboarding and reduced support burden
**Effort**: Medium (1-2 weeks)

#### 4. **Establish Documentation-as-Code Governance**
