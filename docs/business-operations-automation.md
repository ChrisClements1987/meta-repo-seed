# Business Operations Automation - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of **Issue #98: Business Operations Automation for self-governing systems**. The implementation provides complete automation for business operations, enabling repositories to operate with minimal manual intervention while maintaining compliance and governance standards.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Business Operations Automation System

**Location:** `src/automation/business_operations.py`

The core system provides:
- **Self-governing repository management** with automated policy enforcement
- **Business profile-specific automation** for different organization types
- **Multi-level automation** (conservative, standard, aggressive)
- **Comprehensive workflow orchestration** for all business operations

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow Templates

**Location:** `templates/business-operations/workflows/`

Four critical automation workflows:

#### Automated Onboarding (`automated-onboarding.yml`)
- **Repository structure setup** with governance directories
- **Team and permission configuration** based on business profile
- **Branch protection rules** automatically applied
- **Governance policies** initialized and enforced
- **Compliance checklist** generation for manual verification
- **Automated reporting** setup and configuration

#### Compliance Enforcement (`compliance-enforcement.yml`)
- **Weekly compliance validation** across all business requirements
- **License compliance checking** with dependency scanning
- **Code quality enforcement** with profile-specific thresholds
- **Documentation standards validation** including completeness checks
- **Security vulnerability scanning** with automated reporting
- **Governance policy validation** ensuring all policies are current

#### Self-Healing and Auto-Remediation (`self-healing.yml`)
- **6-hour health assessment** cycles for continuous monitoring
- **Configuration drift detection** with automatic correction
- **Branch protection restoration** when rules are modified
- **Dependency security updates** with automated pull requests
- **Missing workflow restoration** for critical automation components
- **Issue escalation** for problems requiring human intervention

#### Automated Reporting (`business-reporting.yml`)
- **Weekly business metrics** generation and reporting
- **Compliance dashboard** updates with current status
- **Audit log summarization** for stakeholder review
- **Status badge** updates reflecting system health
- **Stakeholder notification** for critical issues

### 3. Business Profile Support

Four distinct business profiles with tailored automation:

#### Startup Basic
- **Growth-ready infrastructure** with professional standards
- **Investor-ready documentation** automatically maintained
- **Lean compliance** focused on essential requirements
- **Rapid iteration** support with minimal friction

#### Charity/Non-Profit
- **Transparency policy** enforcement with donor privacy protection
- **Impact reporting** automation for stakeholder communication
- **Board oversight** mechanisms built into governance
- **Cost-optimized** operations with enhanced compliance

#### Small-Medium Business (SMB)
- **Professional operations** with operational simplicity
- **Business continuity** procedures and compliance
- **Employee access controls** with contractor management
- **Professional service** standards enforcement

#### Consulting Firm
- **Client confidentiality** strict enforcement and monitoring
- **Partner approval** workflows for sensitive operations
- **Professional service** delivery standards
- **Client data protection** with segregated access controls

### 4. Integration with Existing Infrastructure

**Enhanced CLI Commands:**
- `start-onboarding` command now deploys complete business operations automation
- Support for `--profile`, `--automation-level`, `--org-name`, `--repo-name` options
- Dry-run capability for testing before deployment

**Blueprint Integration:**
- Extended organization blueprints with business automation configuration
- Example blueprint: `startup-basic-with-automation.yaml`
- Business operations section in blueprint schema

### 5. Governance and Compliance Framework

**Automated Policy Management:**
- **CODEOWNERS** files generated based on business profile requirements
- **Branch protection** rules customized for each profile's needs
- **Governance policies** automatically applied and maintained
- **Compliance frameworks** with profile-specific requirements

**Self-Governing Operations:**
- **Policy drift detection** with automatic correction
- **Compliance monitoring** with weekly validation cycles
- **Governance rule enforcement** without manual intervention
- **Audit trail maintenance** for all automated actions

## Usage Examples

### 1. Deploy Complete Business Operations Automation

```bash
# Deploy for a startup with standard automation
python -m meta-repo-seed start-onboarding \
    --profile startup-basic \
    --automation-level standard \
    --org-name my-startup \
    --repo-name awesome-product

# Deploy for a charity with enhanced transparency
python -m meta-repo-seed start-onboarding \
    --profile charity-nonprofit \
    --automation-level standard \
    --org-name helping-hands-charity
```

### 2. Test Before Deployment

```bash
# Dry run to preview what would be deployed
python -m meta-repo-seed start-onboarding \
    --profile consulting-firm \
    --automation-level aggressive \
    --dry-run
```

### 3. Business Profile Customization

Each profile provides different automation characteristics:

- **startup-basic**: Growth-ready, investor-focused, lean compliance
