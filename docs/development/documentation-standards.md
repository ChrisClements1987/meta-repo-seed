    environment_variables:
      STARTUP_SCALE: "small|medium|large" # Default: small
      ENABLE_ANALYTICS: "true|false"      # Default: true
```

### üìã Process/Research Documentation
**When Required:** Analysis, research, audits, internal process documentation  
**Purpose:** Capture internal work, decisions, and institutional knowledge

#### Flexible Requirements:
- **Analysis/Research Documents** (`docs/analysis/`, `docs/research/`)

#### Example - Gap Analysis:
```markdown
# GitFlow Development Workflow Gap Analysis

## Executive Summary
Analysis of GitFlow v3.1 research against current implementation reveals 
12 gaps requiring implementation, with 4 critical priorities.

## Key Findings
- Missing CI/CD status checks in rulesets
- No structured documentation standards
- Missing hotfix workflow for emergencies

## Recommendations
1. Implement critical infrastructure gaps (Week 1)
2. Process enhancements (Weeks 2-3)  
3. Automation optimization (Month 2)
```

## Smart Categorization Logic

### How to Determine Documentation Requirements:

## Integration with PR Process

### PR Template Workflow:
1. **Select Change Category** - Choose from 4 options in PR template
2. **Follow Applicable Standards** - Complete relevant documentation sections
3. **Skip Non-Applicable Sections** - Clear guidance on what to skip
4. **Validate Completeness** - Use checklist to ensure coverage

### Review Process:
- **Reviewers verify** documentation matches change category
- **Documentation quality** becomes part of approval criteria  
- **Flexible enforcement** for internal/research work
