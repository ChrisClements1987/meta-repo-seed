# Spike Summary: Business Operations Automation for Self-Governing Systems

**Related Issue:** [#98 - CRITICAL: Add Business Operations Automation for self-governing systems](https://github.com/ChrisClements1987/meta-repo-seed/issues/98)

## Purpose
Clarify the scope, requirements, and deliverables for automating business operations in the meta-repo-seed system, enabling self-governing repository setups.

## Definitions
- **Business Operations Automation:** Automated workflows and processes that support core business functions (e.g., onboarding, compliance, reporting, governance) within seeded repositories.
- **Self-Governing Systems:** Repository setups that enforce policies, automate maintenance, and ensure compliance with minimal manual intervention.

## Research & Findings
1. **Existing Documentation & Templates:**
   - Templates exist for infrastructure, code formatting, governance, and audit management.
   - No dedicated business operations automation templates or scripts identified.
2. **Best Practices:**
   - Use workflow automation (e.g., GitHub Actions) for onboarding, compliance checks, reporting, and periodic audits.
   - Integrate governance policies (CODEOWNERS, branch protection, audit logs).
   - Automate notifications and escalation for compliance failures.

## Requirements
- Automate onboarding (repo creation, initial settings, access control).
- Enforce compliance (license checks, code quality, documentation standards).
- Automate reporting (status dashboards, audit logs, compliance summaries).
- Integrate governance (CODEOWNERS, branch protection, PR review rules).
- Support periodic audits and self-healing (auto-remediation of common issues).

## Integration Points
- Extend existing templates to include business operations workflows.
- Add automation scripts for onboarding, compliance, and reporting.
- Leverage GitHub Actions and repository settings as code.

## Deliverables
- Requirements document (this file)
- List of actionable sub-tasks:
  1. Design business operations workflow templates
  2. Implement onboarding automation
  3. Add compliance enforcement scripts
  4. Automate reporting and audit logging
  5. Integrate governance policies
  6. Document usage and integration

## Next Steps
- Review and validate requirements with stakeholders/AI agents
- Refine deliverables and break down into implementation issues
- Begin development after consensus
