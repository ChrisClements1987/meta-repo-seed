# GitHub Integration Guide

The Meta-Repo Seed system provides seamless integration with GitHub to automate repository creation, setup branch protection, and configure essential GitHub features. This guide covers all aspects of GitHub integration.

## üéØ Overview

GitHub integration enables:
- **Automated Repository Creation**: Create repositories directly from the seeding script
- **Branch Protection**: Set up branch protection rules automatically
- **Issue Templates**: Include comprehensive issue and PR templates
- **GitHub Actions**: Pre-configured CI/CD workflows
- **Team Management**: Configure repository settings for team collaboration

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
1. **GitHub CLI**: Install and authenticate with GitHub CLI
2. **Git Configuration**: Ensure git is configured with your GitHub credentials
3. **Repository Access**: Appropriate permissions for repository creation

### Basic GitHub Integration

```bash
# Create repository and seed with GitHub integration
python seeding.py --github-integration

# Create private repository
python seeding.py --github-integration --private

# Create repository in organization
python seeding.py --github-integration --organization "my-org"
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Command Line Options

```bash
# Basic GitHub options
python seeding.py \
  --github-integration \
  --github-username "your-username" \
  --private \
  --create-repo

# Advanced GitHub options  
python seeding.py \
  --github-integration \
  --github-username "your-username" \
  --organization "your-org" \
  --private \
  --branch-protection \
  --create-repo \
  --setup-teams
```

### Configuration File Integration

```yaml
# github-config.yml
github:
  enabled: true
  username: "your-github-username"
  organization: "your-organization"  # Optional
  create_repo: true
  private: false
  branch_protection: true
  
  # Repository settings
  repository:
    description: "Project created with meta-repo-seed"
    homepage: "https://your-project-site.com"
    topics: ["meta-repo", "automation", "github"]
    has_issues: true
    has_projects: true
    has_wiki: false
    
  # Branch protection settings
  branch_protection:
    branch: "main"
    required_reviews: 2
    dismiss_stale_reviews: true
    require_code_owner_reviews: true
    required_status_checks:
      - "ci/build"
      - "ci/test"
    restrict_pushes: true
    allowed_push_users: ["admin-user"]
    
  # Team management
  teams:
    - name: "developers"
      permission: "push"
    - name: "maintainers"  
      permission: "admin"
```

## üîí Repository Security Setup

### Branch Protection Rules

The system automatically configures branch protection with:

```yaml
branch_protection:
  # Require pull request reviews
  required_reviews: 2
  dismiss_stale_reviews: true
  require_code_owner_reviews: true
  
  # Require status checks
  required_status_checks:
    - "continuous-integration"
    - "security-scan"
    - "quality-gate"
    
  # Restrict direct pushes
  restrict_pushes: true
  allowed_push_users: []  # Only admins can push directly
  
  # Additional protections
  allow_force_pushes: false
  allow_deletions: false
  required_linear_history: true
```

### Security Policies

Automatically includes:
- **Security Policy** (`SECURITY.md`)
- **Code of Conduct** (`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`)
- **Contributing Guidelines** (`CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- **Issue Templates** (Bug reports, feature requests)
- **Pull Request Templates**

  secrets:
    - name: "API_KEY"
      description: "API key for external service"
    - name: "DATABASE_URL"
      description: "Database connection string"

```yaml
github:
  webhooks:
    - url: "https://your-service.com/webhook"
      events: ["push", "pull_request", "issues"]
      secret: "webhook-secret"
      active: true
```

### Repository Visibility and Access

```yaml
github:
  repository:
    private: true
    visibility: "private"  # public, private, internal
    
    # Access control
    permissions:
      issues: "enabled"
      projects: "enabled" 
      wiki: "disabled"
      downloads: "enabled"
      
    # Merge settings
    merge_settings:
      allow_merge_commit: true
      allow_squash_merge: true
      allow_rebase_merge: false
      delete_branch_on_merge: true
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**GitHub CLI not authenticated**
```bash
Error: GitHub CLI not authenticated
```
Solution:
```bash
# Login to GitHub CLI
gh auth login

# Verify authentication
gh auth status
```

**Insufficient permissions**
```bash
Error: Insufficient permissions to create repository
```
Solutions:
- Ensure GitHub token has `repo` scope
- Verify organization membership and permissions
- Check if repository name conflicts with existing repo

**Branch protection setup failed**
```bash
Warning: Failed to set up branch protection rules
```
Solutions:
- Ensure repository has at least one commit
- Verify admin permissions on repository
- Check if branch exists before setting protection

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test GitHub integration without creating files
python seeding.py --github-integration --dry-run --verbose

# Verify GitHub CLI setup
gh auth status
gh repo list

# Test repository creation
gh repo create test-repo --private --confirm
gh repo delete test-repo --confirm
```

### Recovery Procedures

**Repository Creation Failed**
```bash
# Clean up failed repository
gh repo delete failed-repo --confirm

# Retry with different settings
python seeding.py --github-integration --project-name "new-name"
```

**Branch Protection Issues**
```bash
# Reset branch protection
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection -X DELETE

# Reapply protection rules
python seeding.py --update-github-settings
```

## üìä Monitoring and Analytics

### Repository Insights

The system can optionally set up:
- **Traffic Analytics**: Monitor repository views and clones
- **Contributor Insights**: Track contributor activity
- **Security Advisories**: Monitor security alerts
- **Dependency Insights**: Track dependency updates

### Integration Health Checks

```yaml
github:
  monitoring:
    health_checks:
      - workflow_runs: true
      - branch_protection: true
      - security_alerts: true
      - dependency_updates: true
      
    notifications:
      slack_webhook: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."
      email: "team@example.com"
```

## üöÄ Best Practices

### Repository Naming
- Use kebab-case for repository names
- Include organization prefix for team projects
- Keep names descriptive but concise

### Branch Strategy
- Use `main` as the default branch
- Implement feature branch workflow
- Set up branch protection on `main` and `develop`

### Security
- Enable branch protection rules
- Require code reviews for all changes
- Set up automated security scanning
- Use repository secrets for sensitive data

### Documentation
- Include comprehensive README.md
- Add clear contributing guidelines
- Maintain up-to-date issue templates
- Document deployment and setup procedures
