# Use Architecture Decision Records

## Context and Problem Statement

We need a way to document architectural decisions for future reference and team alignment. Currently, decisions are made in meetings but not consistently recorded, leading to confusion and repeated discussions.

## Decision Drivers

* Need historical record of decisions and rationale
* Improve team communication and alignment
* Support new team member onboarding
* Enable better change impact assessment

## Considered Options

* **Confluence documentation**: Traditional wiki approach
* **Architecture Decision Records**: Lightweight markdown in code repository
* **No formal documentation**: Continue current ad-hoc approach

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: "Architecture Decision Records", because they are lightweight, version-controlled, and integrated with our development workflow.

### Consequences

* **Positive**: Decisions are preserved with context and rationale
* **Positive**: Easy to reference during code reviews and planning
* **Negative**: Requires discipline to maintain consistency
* **Negative**: Initial overhead to establish templates and process

### Confirmation

Success will be measured by consistent ADR creation for major decisions and positive feedback from team during quarterly retrospectives.
```

## When to Create an ADR

### Always Create ADRs For
- **Technology choices**: Frameworks, databases, cloud services
- **Architectural patterns**: Microservices, event sourcing, CQRS
- **Infrastructure decisions**: Deployment strategies, monitoring approaches
- **Security implementations**: Authentication methods, data encryption
- **Integration approaches**: API designs, message formats

### Consider ADRs For
- **Process changes**: Development workflows, testing strategies
- **Tool selections**: CI/CD platforms, monitoring tools
- **Data models**: Schema designs, migration strategies
- **Performance optimizations**: Caching strategies, scaling approaches

### Don't Create ADRs For
- **Routine development tasks**: Bug fixes, small features
- **Temporary decisions**: Short-term workarounds, experimental code
- **Personal preferences**: Code formatting, naming conventions
- **Already documented**: Existing architectural principles

### Decision Tree

```
Is this decision...
├── Difficult to reverse? ────────────── YES ──→ CREATE ADR
├── Affects multiple teams? ─────────── YES ──→ CREATE ADR  
├── Has significant trade-offs? ──────── YES ──→ CREATE ADR
├── Establishes a pattern? ───────────── YES ──→ CREATE ADR
└── Otherwise ─────────────────────────── NO ───→ SKIP ADR
```

## Step-by-Step ADR Creation

### Step 1: Preparation (5 minutes)
1. **Identify the decision** clearly - what specific choice needs to be made?
2. **Gather context** - what problem are you solving?
3. **List stakeholders** - who needs to be involved in the decision?
4. **Set timeline** - when does this decision need to be made?

### Step 2: Research and Options (30-60 minutes)
1. **Research alternatives** - what options are available?
2. **Define decision drivers** - what criteria matter most?
3. **Evaluate pros and cons** for each option
4. **Consider constraints** - budget, timeline, expertise, compliance

### Step 3: Write the ADR (20-30 minutes)
1. **Start with the template** - use the standard format
2. **Write clearly and concisely** - aim for 1-2 pages maximum
3. **Focus on reasoning** - explain why, not just what
4. **Include enough detail** for future reference

### Step 4: Review and Discussion (varies)
1. **Share draft** with relevant stakeholders
2. **Gather feedback** and incorporate changes
3. **Hold decision meeting** if needed
4. **Reach consensus** or make executive decision

### Step 5: Finalize and Communicate (10 minutes)
1. **Update status** to "accepted" or "rejected"
2. **Add final decision rationale**
3. **Commit to repository**
4. **Notify affected teams**

## Writing Guidelines

### Title Best Practices
- **Use present tense, active voice**: "Use OAuth 2.0 for Authentication"
- **Be specific and actionable**: Not "Authentication" but "Use JWT tokens for API authentication"
- **Start with a verb when possible**: "Implement", "Use", "Adopt", "Replace"
- **Keep it concise**: 5-10 words maximum

**Good titles:**
- "Use PostgreSQL for Primary Database"
- "Implement Event Sourcing for Order Management"
- "Adopt Microservices Architecture"

**Poor titles:**
- "Database Decision" (too vague)
- "We decided to use PostgreSQL" (past tense)
- "The Ultimate Solution for Our Complex Authentication and Authorization Requirements" (too long)

### Context and Problem Statement
- **Start with the problem**, not the solution
- **Include relevant constraints** and requirements
- **Provide just enough background** for understanding
- **Avoid solution bias** in problem description

**Example:**
```markdown
Our API currently has no authentication mechanism, allowing unrestricted access 
to sensitive customer data. We need to implement authentication that supports 
both mobile apps and web applications, integrates with our existing user 
database, and meets SOC 2 compliance requirements.
```

### Decision Drivers
- **Focus on the "why"** behind requirements
- **Include quality attributes**: performance, security, usability
- **Mention business constraints**: budget, timeline, compliance
- **Prioritize the list** - put most important factors first

### Considered Options
- **Be comprehensive but concise** - include major alternatives
- **Use parallel structure** for consistency
- **Briefly explain each option** in 1-2 sentences
- **Don't pre-judge options** in the descriptions

### Decision Outcome
- **State the decision clearly** and unambiguously
- **Lead with the choice**, then justify
- **Keep justification brief** - save details for pros/cons section
- **Avoid apologetic language** - be confident in the decision

### Consequences
- **Be honest about trade-offs** - include real negatives
- **Think beyond immediate impact** - consider long-term effects
- **Be specific** rather than generic
- **Balance positive and negative** consequences

**Good consequences:**
- "Positive: Reduces authentication logic complexity in individual services"
- "Negative: Introduces single point of failure for authentication"

**Poor consequences:**
- "Positive: Good choice" (too generic)
- "Negative: Might have some issues" (too vague)

## Review and Approval Process

### Standard Review Workflow

1. **Author creates ADR** with status "proposed"
2. **Stakeholders review** within 1 week (configurable)
3. **Discussion and iteration** as needed
4. **Decision meeting** if consensus isn't reached
5. **Final approval** and status update to "accepted"
6. **Communication** to affected teams

### Review Checklist

**Content Quality:**

2. **Escalate to appropriate decision maker** (tech lead, architect, etc.)
3. **Set clear timeline** for final decision
4. **Record dissenting opinions** in the ADR
5. **Focus on moving forward** once decision is made

### Review Templates

**Review Comment Template:**
```
## Review by [Name] - [Date]

**Overall Assessment**: Approve / Needs Changes / Reject

**Specific Feedback:**
- Context: [Comments on problem statement and background]

```

## Maintaining ADRs

### Lifecycle Management

**ADR States and Transitions:**
```
proposed → accepted → implemented
       ↘ rejected
                    
accepted → deprecated → superseded
        ↘ superseded (by new ADR)
```

### When to Update ADR Status

**To "implemented":**
- When the decision has been fully put into practice
- All systems are updated according to the decision
- Success criteria from "Confirmation" section have been met

**To "deprecated":**
- Decision is no longer considered best practice
- System evolution has made the decision less relevant
- Better approaches have been discovered

**To "superseded":**
- A new ADR explicitly replaces this one
- Link to the superseding ADR
- Keep original ADR for historical context

### Updating ADRs

**Never modify the core decision content** of an accepted ADR. Instead:

**For small clarifications:**
- Add "Update" sections at the bottom
- Include date and reason for the update
- Preserve original decision reasoning

**For significant changes:**
- Create a new ADR that supersedes the old one
- Reference the original ADR
- Explain what changed and why

**Update example:**
```markdown
## Updates

### 2024-10-15: Implementation Notes Added
Added section on database migration strategy based on lessons learned during implementation.

### 2024-11-01: Performance Benchmarks
Added actual performance results after 6 months in production. Results exceeded expectations by 15%.

**Simple ADR creation script (`scripts/new-adr.sh`):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get next ADR number
last_adr=$(find docs/adr -name "[0-9]*.md" | sort -V | tail -1)
if [ -n "$last_adr" ]; then
  last_num=$(basename "$last_adr" | sed 's/^\([0-9]\+\).*/\1/')
  next_num=$(printf "%04d" $((10#$last_num + 1)))
else
  next_num="0001"
fi

# Adopt Microservices Architecture

## Context and Problem Statement

Our monolithic application is becoming difficult to maintain and deploy. 
Team velocity is decreasing due to coordination overhead, and we need 
to scale different components independently.

## Decision Drivers

* Need independent deployment of services
* Want to enable team autonomy and ownership
* Require different scaling characteristics per component
* Must support polyglot technology choices
* Need improved fault isolation

## Considered Options

* **Modular Monolith**: Improve internal structure while keeping single deployment
* **Microservices**: Break apart into independent services
* **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Larger services with shared infrastructure

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: "Microservices", because it provides the independence and scalability we need for our growth trajectory.

### Consequences

* **Positive**: Teams can deploy independently
* **Positive**: Better fault isolation between services
* **Positive**: Technology diversity enables best tool choices
* **Negative**: Increased operational complexity
* **Negative**: Network communication overhead
* **Negative**: Distributed system challenges (consistency, monitoring)

### Confirmation

Success will be measured by:
- 50% reduction in deployment conflicts between teams
- Ability to scale individual services based on demand
- Improved team velocity metrics within 6 months
```

**Database choice:**

# Use PostgreSQL for Primary Database

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to select a primary database for our new application. Requirements 
include ACID compliance, complex queries, JSON support, and strong consistency.

## Decision Drivers

* ACID compliance for financial transactions
* Complex relational queries with good performance  
* JSON document support for flexible schemas
* Strong ecosystem and community support
* Team expertise and learning curve
* Operational complexity and cost

## Considered Options

* **PostgreSQL**: Advanced open-source relational database
* **MySQL**: Popular open-source relational database  
* **MongoDB**: Document database with flexible schemas
* **Amazon RDS Aurora**: Managed cloud-native database

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: "PostgreSQL", because it provides the best combination of 
relational integrity, JSON support, and advanced features we need.

### Consequences

* **Positive**: Excellent performance for complex queries
* **Positive**: Strong consistency and ACID compliance
* **Positive**: JSON support provides schema flexibility
* **Positive**: Rich ecosystem and extensive documentation
* **Negative**: Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with advanced features
* **Negative**: Requires more careful tuning than simpler databases

### Confirmation

Success will be measured by query performance benchmarks meeting SLA requirements 
and successful handling of projected load without data consistency issues.

# Use AWS as Primary Cloud Provider

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to select a cloud infrastructure provider for our production deployment. 
Requirements include global availability, managed database services, 
container orchestration, and cost-effectiveness.

## Decision Drivers

* Service breadth and maturity
* Geographic availability and compliance
* Cost structure and pricing model
* Team expertise and learning curve
* Vendor lock-in considerations
* Integration with existing tools

## Considered Options

* **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Market leader with comprehensive services
* **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Strong in containers and data analytics
* **Microsoft Azure**: Good integration with Microsoft ecosystem
* **Multi-cloud**: Use multiple providers for different services

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: "AWS", because it provides the most mature service offering 
and our team has the most experience with AWS services.

### Consequences

* **Positive**: Comprehensive service catalog reduces vendor proliferation
* **Positive**: Mature services with strong SLAs
* **Positive**: Team expertise reduces learning curve
* **Negative**: Potential for vendor lock-in
* **Negative**: Complex pricing model can lead to unexpected costs

### Confirmation

Success will be measured by:
- Meeting 99.9% uptime SLA requirements
- Infrastructure costs staying within 15% of budget projections
- Team productivity maintaining current levels during migration

# Use OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect for Authentication

## Context and Problem Statement

We need a secure authentication mechanism that supports both web and mobile 
clients, integrates with existing identity providers, and meets SOC 2 
compliance requirements.

## Decision Drivers

* Security best practices and industry standards
* Support for multiple client types (web, mobile, API)
* Integration with existing identity providers (Active Directory)
* Compliance requirements (SOC 2, GDPR)
* User experience and single sign-on
* Implementation complexity and maintenance

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: "OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect", because it's the industry 
standard that meets our security and integration requirements.

### Consequences

* **Positive**: Industry-standard security model
* **Positive**: Supports SSO and external identity providers
* **Positive**: Scales to support multiple applications
* **Negative**: Added complexity compared to simple session-based auth
* **Negative**: Requires careful implementation to avoid security vulnerabilities

### Confirmation

Security audit will validate implementation against OAuth 2.0 security 
best practices, and compliance review will verify SOC 2 requirements are met.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Problems and Solutions

**Problem: ADRs are too long and nobody reads them**
- **Solution**: Use the minimal template for simple decisions
- **Solution**: Focus on the decision and rationale, not exhaustive analysis
- **Solution**: Aim for 1-2 pages maximum
- **Solution**: Use bullet points and clear headings

**Problem: Team doesn't remember to create ADRs**
- **Solution**: Integrate ADR creation into existing processes (code review, planning)
- **Solution**: Add ADR requirements to definition of done
- **Solution**: Use automation to remind teams when changes affect architecture
- **Solution**: Make ADR creation part of RFC or design review process

**Problem: ADRs become outdated quickly**
- **Solution**: Don't try to keep ADRs current - create
