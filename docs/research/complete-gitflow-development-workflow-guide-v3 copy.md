# Business-in-a-Box Development Workflow: A GitFlow Guide

## 1. Philosophy & Guiding Principles

This document outlines our GitFlow methodology and development lifecycle, specifically tailored for Business-in-a-Box projects where rapid deployment, maintainability, and professional standards are paramount. Our process serves the unique needs of startup-focused infrastructure automation while maintaining enterprise-grade quality.

Our workflow is designed around these four core principles:

* **🛡️ Stability:** The `main` branch is always production-ready and deployable. It represents our unbreakable source of truth for Business-in-a-Box deployments.
* **🚀 Quality:** Quality is built into every step through automated testing, security scanning, and business validation - ensuring the 10-minute deployment promise is maintained.
* **🤝 Clarity:** Project state, change history, and work-in-progress are always transparent to support both human developers and AI assistance tools.
* **💨 Velocity:** By creating predictable, safe processes, we enable rapid iteration on Business-in-a-Box features while maintaining professional standards.

### Business-in-a-Box Context

This workflow specifically supports:
- **10-minute deployment promise** for complete business infrastructure
- **Single maintainer with contributors** model rather than large teams
- **Startup, charity, and SMB focus** requiring streamlined processes
- **Professional standards** that inspire confidence in enterprise adoption
- **AI-assisted development** where appropriate, while maintaining human oversight

### AI Integration Reality Check

AI tools (Claude, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) can enhance our development workflow, but we maintain realistic expectations:

**✅ AI Strengths:**
- Code completion and boilerplate generation
- Test case suggestions for well-defined requirements
- Documentation writing assistance
- Code review supplement (not replacement)
- Pattern recognition for common issues

**⚠️ AI Limitations:**
- Domain-specific business logic (Business-in-a-Box context)
- Complex architectural decisions
- Security vulnerability assessment
- Performance optimization for specific use cases
- Understanding of project-specific constraints

**🎯 AI Integration Approach:**
- Use AI as a **supplementary tool**, not primary workflow driver
- Always validate AI suggestions against business requirements
- Maintain human review for all business-critical decisions
- Leverage AI for documentation and routine coding tasks

## 2. The Branching Strategy

We use a simplified GitFlow model optimized for Business-in-a-Box development, with two main long-lived branches and supporting short-lived branches.

### Main Branches

#### `main`
* **Purpose:** Contains production-ready code for Business-in-a-Box deployments. This branch represents the official release history.
* **Rules:**
    * Code in `main` **must** be deployable within 10 minutes (Business-in-a-Box promise)
    * Direct commits are **strictly forbidden**
    * Code enters `main` only through release merges or hotfixes
    * Each merge to `main` **must** be tagged with a semantic version (e.g., `v1.2.0`)
    * **Required protections:**
        * ✅ At least 1 approval (appropriate for maintainer + contributor model)
        * ✅ All CI checks must pass (including business validation)
        * ✅ No direct pushes (even from maintainers)

#### `develop`
* **Purpose:** Integration branch for Business-in-a-Box features. Contains the latest development changes for the next release.
* **Rules:**
    * While generally stable, may contain features not yet validated for Business-in-a-Box deployment
    * Direct commits are **forbidden**
    * Code enters through feature branch merges only
    * **Required protections:**
        * ✅ At least 1 approval
        * ✅ All CI checks must pass (including business validation tests)

### Supporting Branches

#### `feature/*`
* **Purpose:** Developing new Business-in-a-Box features or non-critical improvements
* **Branches From:** `develop`
* **Merges To:** `develop`
* **Naming Convention:** `feature/issue-123-short-description` (e.g., `feature/issue-42-business-profile-templates`)
* **Maximum Lifespan:** 3-5 days to maintain rapid Business-in-a-Box iteration
* **Deletion:** Automatically deleted after squash merge

#### `release/*`
* **Purpose:** Prepare Business-in-a-Box releases with final testing and stabilization
* **Branches From:** `develop`
* **Merges To:** `main` (for release) AND `develop` (to incorporate fixes)
* **Naming Convention:** `release/v1.2.0`
* **Lifespan:** 1-2 days maximum (supports rapid Business-in-a-Box release cycle)
* **Activities:** Business validation testing, documentation finalization, version bumping

#### `hotfix/*`
* **Purpose:** Critical fixes for production Business-in-a-Box deployments
* **Branches From:** `main`
* **Merges To:** `main` AND `develop`
* **Naming Convention:** `hotfix/v1.2.1-critical-deployment-fix`
* **Criteria for hotfix:**
    * Business-in-a-Box deployment completely broken
    * Security vulnerabilities in deployed infrastructure
    * Data loss or corruption in business templates
    * Critical startup/SMB functionality failures

### Branch Flow for Business-in-a-Box

- Security vulnerability in deployed business infrastructure
- Data corruption in business templates
- Critical functionality broken for all business types
- Compliance issues affecting professional standards

**📅 Use Regular Process When:**
- Bug affects only some business profiles
- Workaround exists for target market
- Can wait for next sprint release
- Non-critical feature improvements

### Emergency Response Workflow

**1. Incident Declaration**
```bash
# Team communication:
"🚨 HOTFIX: Business-in-a-Box deployment failing for all startup profiles
Working on: hotfix/v1.2.1-startup-template-fix
ETA: 2 hours
Impact: All new business deployments blocked"
```

**2. Create Hotfix Branch**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/v1.2.1-startup-template-fix
git push -u origin hotfix/v1.2.1-startup-template-fix
```

**3. Minimal Fix Implementation**
- **Focus:** Minimal change to restore Business-in-a-Box functionality
- **Avoid:** Unrelated improvements or refactoring
- **Include:** Test that would have caught the issue
- **Validate:** Fix works for all affected business profiles

```bash
git commit -m "fix(startup): resolve template processing error

Critical fix for startup business profile deployment failure.
Template variable replacement was failing due to encoding issue
affecting Windows deployment environments.

Restores 10-minute deployment capability for startup profiles.

Fixes critical deployment blocking issue."
```

**4. Expedited Review Process**
- **Approval:** 1 approval from senior developer (faster than normal)
- **Focus:** Fix effectiveness and safety, not perfect code
- **Testing:** Automated tests + manual business validation
- **Documentation:** Update can be post-fix if necessary

**5. Emergency Deployment**
```bash
# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff hotfix/v1.2.1-startup-template-fix
git push origin main

# Tag immediately
git tag -a v1.2.1 -m "Hotfix v1.2.1: Critical startup deployment fix"
git push origin v1.2.1

# Auto-deployment triggers immediately
```

**6. Sync with Development**
```bash
# Merge to develop and any active release branches
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff hotfix/v1.2.1-startup-template-fix
git push origin develop

# Clean up
git branch -d hotfix/v1.2.1-startup-template-fix
git push origin --delete hotfix/v1.2.1-startup-template-fix
```

**7. Post-Incident Process**
**Required within 48 hours:**
- [ ] Post-mortem review (no blame, focus on process improvement)
- [ ] Root cause analysis
- [ ] Process improvements to prevent recurrence
- [ ] Update Business-in-a-Box testing to catch similar issues
- [ ] Communication to affected users/stakeholders

---

## 6. Conflict Resolution

Merge conflicts are common in active Business-in-a-Box development. Handle them professionally and efficiently.

### During Feature Development Rebase

```bash
# Common scenario: Daily rebase hits conflicts
git pull --rebase origin develop

# Git pauses at conflicts
git status  # Shows conflicted files

# Resolve each file manually
# Look for: <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>

# Stage resolved files
git add path/to/resolved-file.py

# Continue rebase
git rebase --continue

# If stuck or confused
git rebase --abort  # Start over
```

**Business-in-a-Box Conflict Resolution Tips:**
- **Business Logic:** When in doubt, preserve existing business profile functionality
- **Performance:** Choose the solution that maintains 10-minute deployment goal
- **Documentation:** Merge both sets of documentation improvements when possible
- **AI Assistance:** Share conflict context with AI for merge suggestions, but validate business impact

### Large Conflict Prevention

**For Small Teams (Business-in-a-Box Context):**
- **Daily standups:** Quick sync on file changes
- **Feature coordination:** Avoid multiple people modifying same business profiles
- **Modular design:** Keep business profiles and core system separated
- **Feature flags:** Merge incomplete features safely

---

## 7. Rollback & Business Continuity

Business-in-a-Box rollbacks prioritize rapid restoration of service to startups, charities, and SMBs.

### Rollback Decision Matrix

**🔴 Immediate Rollback:**
- Business-in-a-Box deployment completely down
- Data corruption affecting business templates
- Security breach in deployed infrastructure
- All business profile types failing

**🟡 Monitor and Decide:**
- One business profile type affected
- Performance degradation (>10 minute deployments)
- Subset of target market affected
- Non-critical feature issues

### Business-Focused Rollback Process

**Option 1: Deploy Previous Version (Fastest)**
```bash
# Find last known good version
git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -5

# Deploy specific version
git checkout v1.2.0
./scripts/deploy-business-in-a-box.sh production
```

**Option 2: Revert and Re-release**
```bash
git checkout main
git revert <commit-hash>
git tag -a v1.2.2 -m "Revert v1.2.1: Business-in-a-Box stability fix"
git push origin main --tags
```

**Business Communication During Rollback:**
- Immediate notification to Business-in-a-Box users
- Clear timeline for resolution
- Alternative deployment options if available
- Post-resolution communication with lessons learned

## 10. Troubleshooting & Common Scenarios

### Business-in-a-Box Specific Issues

**"Business deployment exceeds 10-minute goal"**
```bash
# Profile performance issue
# 1. Run performance benchmarks
python scripts/benchmark_business_profiles.py

# 2. Identify bottlenecks
python -m cProfile -o profile.stats seeding.py --profile startup-basic

# 3. Optimize critical path
# Focus on template processing, file I/O, network calls

# 4. Re-test with timer
time python seeding.py --profile startup-basic --dry-run
```

**"Business profile fails for specific target market"**
```bash
# Debug business profile issue
# 1. Test specific profile
python seeding.py --profile charity-nonprofit --verbose --dry-run

# 2. Check template compatibility
python scripts/validate_business_templates.py charity-nonprofit

# 3. Review business requirements
# Check if profile matches actual charity needs

# 4. Update profile based on user feedback
```

**"AI suggestions don't match business context"**
- **Problem:** AI doesn't understand Business-in-a-Box specific requirements
- **Solution:** Provide more business context in prompts
- **Example:** Instead of "add validation," use "add validation for nonprofit tax-exemption status in charity business profile"

### Standard Git Issues

**"Accidentally committed to develop directly"**
```bash
# If not pushed yet
git branch feature/accidental-work
git reset --hard origin/develop
git checkout feature/accidental-work
# Create proper PR

# If already pushed (requires maintainer)
# Contact maintainer for force-push permission
```

**"Feature branch far behind develop"**
```bash
# Option 1: Rebase (preferred)
git checkout feature/my-branch
git pull --rebase origin develop
# Resolve conflicts carefully

# Option 2: Fresh start if rebase too complex
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout -b feature/my-branch-v2
git cherry-pick <select commits from original branch>
```

**"CI passes locally but fails in GitHub Actions"**
Common Business-in-a-Box issues:
1. **Platform differences:** Test on Windows/macOS/Linux
2. **Business validation environments:** Ensure test data matches CI
3. **Performance timing:** CI might be slower, adjust timeouts
4. **Template encoding:** Check UTF-8 handling across platforms
