# Research Brief: Business-in-a-Box Meeting Operating System Integration

**Context:** Meta-Repo-Seed Business-in-a-Box Platform  
**Strategic Alignment:** Five-Domain Architecture (Strategy → EA → Product → Development → Operations)  
**Integration Target:** Self-Governing Business Operations Automation

## 1) Project Goal (One Line)

Design a Meeting Operating System (MeetOS) component for the Business-in-a-Box platform that integrates with our self-governing repository systems, supports the five-domain architecture workflow, and enables automated capture, traceability, and governance for startup/SMB/nonprofit organizations.

---

## 2) Primary Objectives

1. **Survey platforms** compatible with Business-in-a-Box architecture (GitHub-centric, meta-repo structure)
2. **Produce 2-3 architecture options** optimized for startups/SMBs/nonprofits (cost-conscious, automation-heavy)
3. **Define data model** linking meetings to our five domains (Strategy, EA, Product, Development, Operations)
4. **Design integration layer** with existing business operations automation and infrastructure
5. **Produce working artifacts** compatible with meta-repo structure and business profile specializations
6. **Define governance model** aligned with self-governing systems and business automation
7. **Provide implementation plan** as part of Business-in-a-Box template ecosystem
