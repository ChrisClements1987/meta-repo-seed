## üöÄ Complete Workflow

Here's how to use these scripts together for complete feature management:

### 1. Initial Setup (Done Once)
```bash
# Create GitHub labels
gh label create "roadmap" --description "Features from the project roadmap" --color "0E8A16"
gh label create "priority: high" --description "High priority items" --color "D73A4A"
gh label create "priority: medium" --description "Medium priority items" --color "FFA500"
gh label create "priority: low" --description "Low priority items" --color "FBCA04"
```

### 2. Adding New Features
```bash
# Add feature to roadmap
python scripts/roadmap_manager.py add "New Feature" "Description of the feature" --section "High Priority"

# Create GitHub issue for the feature
python scripts/create_roadmap_issues.py --section "High Priority" --limit 1

# Link the issue to the roadmap
python scripts/map_issues_to_roadmap.py
```

### 3. Working on Features
```bash
# List current features with issue numbers
python scripts/roadmap_manager.py list

# Create feature branch (example for issue #5)
git checkout -b feature/issue-5-configuration-file-support

# Work on feature...
git commit -m "Add YAML config loading - addresses #5"
```

### 4. Completing Features
```bash
# Mark feature as complete
python scripts/roadmap_manager.py complete "Configuration File Support" "1.1.0" "Users can save and load project configurations" --issue 5

# Feature is automatically moved from roadmap to changelog
```

### 5. Release Management
```bash
# Generate roadmap report before release
python scripts/roadmap_manager.py report

# Review changelog for release notes
cat CHANGELOG.md
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tips

### Script Maintenance
- All scripts use the same patterns for file reading/writing
- Error handling includes helpful messages
- Support both dry-run and live modes where applicable
- Follow consistent CLI argument patterns

### Adding New Scripts
When adding new management scripts:
1. **Place in `scripts/` directory**
2. **Add documentation to this README**
3. **Follow existing CLI patterns** (argparse, dry-run support)
4. **Include error handling** with helpful messages
5. **Update main README.md** if script is user-facing

### Testing Scripts
Always test scripts in dry-run mode first:
```bash
python scripts/script_name.py --dry-run
```

## üìö Dependencies

All scripts require:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Standard library modules**: `argparse`, `re`, `pathlib`, `json`, `subprocess`

GitHub integration scripts additionally require:
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** installed and authenticated
- **Repository permissions** for creating issues and labels
